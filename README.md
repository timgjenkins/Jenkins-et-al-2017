# The Germ Line Age Calculator

The following steps are outlined to demonstrate the functionality of
the Germ Line Age Calculator. These steps are to be used with the
Illumina methylation array data sets (450k or EPIC). 

There are two options for producing an age prediction from sperm DNA 
methylation array data. The first and simplest is the comprehensive 
code ("ComprehensiveGLACode.R") which will process the data directly 
from idat files. Instructions for this simplified method is can be 
found in the document "Instructions For Comprehesive Code.pdf".

The alternative is working with data that has already undergone 
SWAN normalization to generate beta values via any of the multiple 
options for open source tools (ChAMP, Minfi, etc.) For this option
follow the instructions outlined below.

Access files needed to run the Germ Line Age Calculator:
```
https://github.com/timgjenkins/Jenkins-et-al-2017
```
Load the predictive model in R:
```
model <- readRDS("GLA_Model.rds")
```
Ensure that the package `glmnet` is loaded in R
```
library(glmnet)
```
Data should be organized as seen below with single CpG data listed
row-wise and each sample listed column-wise with the header for the
CpG label (cg0839...) column titled `RN`:
```
RN          X23         X28       X33       X47       X52       X34
cg00050873  0.13191     0.20154   0.107196  0.219992  0.109324  0.0830337

```
Once your file is loaded in R (or as you load the file in R), name the
data frame `e3`.
```
e3 <- read.csv("mydf", header=T)
```
Utilize the subset (`subsetting.R`) code provided to generate a list
of average methylation values for each region included in the
calculator.
```
source('subsetting.R', chdir=TRUE)
```
The object 'subs' will be created that has all of the samples listed
row-wise and the average beta value for region listed column-wise.
```
head(subs)
```
The resulting data frame will look similar to what is seen below:
```
RN  ELANE        FSCN         GPR45        MIR22HG     N23          PTPRN2.3

```
To finish the preparation of the data frame for use in the Germ Line
Age Calculator a `BATCH` column must be added immediately following
the RN column, which contains the Sentrix Barcode number for each
sample (if this is not readily available, you can include `1` in each
position but the `BATCH` column must be present).

Your final file should look similar to this:
```
RN    BATCH      ELANE       FSCN        GPR45       MIR22HG     N23
X23   8942326104 0.187272233 0.736600367 0.215712194 0.250159898 0.389750733

```
Name this data frame `final` and you are prepared to run the
predictor.
```
final <- mydf
```
Once this has been done you are prepared to run the predictive model
on your data using the `Prediction.R` code provided.
```
source('Prediction.R', chdir=TRUE)
```
The output `Predicted.age` is in years and is automatically printed in
the R console but is also stored as `predicted`:
```
print(predicted)

RN    Predicted.age
X23   28.37995901
X27   29.46561255
X28   30.98942059
X33   33.66922111
X33.1 35.51829178
X34   37.74298506
```
